Hello there, and welcome in my school project repo!
I created a Snake game using Python library called Pygame!
Hope you gonna enjoy the game a give me some feedback!

GAME RULES: RULE no.1 - You are controling your game by an arrow keys, Snake is moving on it's own! By pressing the arrow key you're only changing the direction!
            RULE no.2 - Never let the snake escape the egde! Otherwise you will not be able to play the game anymore ;-)
            RULE no.3 - The goal of game is to eat apples and play the game as long as you can! To get the Highest score possible! (The lenght of block that are making your snake is equal to your score)
